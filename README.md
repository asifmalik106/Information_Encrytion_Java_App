# Information Encryption Java App
A Simple Java GUI Application to Encrypt and Decrypt Information.

### **Background** ###
Sometimes we have to save some sensitive and confidential information physically or virtually. As these information should not be exposed publicly, this is a tricky approach to hide main information replacing the main characters. You can easily store any kinds of information just encrypting those with this application.

### **Technical Information** ###
**Information Encryption Java App**(version 1.0) (Release: February 2015) can be used to encrypt information. It just replaces input characters using other specific characters. This app is not case sensitive. You can not get information back with previous input case. To run Information Encryption Java App(version 1.0), please go to directory "Information Encryption Java App v1.0" and follow README.md on that directory.
